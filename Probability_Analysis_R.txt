# 📊 Probability Analysis using R

This project demonstrates how to analyze a continuous probability distribution using R and the `integrate()` function to compute key statistical measures. The probability density function in question is:

> **f(x) = 16·x·e⁻⁴ˣ** for x ≥ 0  
> **f(x) = 0** otherwise

This function defines a gamma distribution, and I used it to perform the following analyses:

## 🔹 A. Tail Probability
Computed the probability that the random variable X exceeds 1.5:
```R
P(X > 1.5)

Output: 0.01735126

## 🔹 B. Find the probability that 1.5 < X < 2.5
This code calculated the probability that the random variable X lies between 1.5 and 2.5.: 

integrate(f, lower = 1.5, upper = 2.5)

Output: 0.01685187

## 🔹 C. Find the expected value of X
To calculate the expected value E(X), we integrate x·f(x) from 0 to ∞:

integrate(function(x) x * f(x), lower = 0, upper = Inf)

Output: 0.5

## 🔹 D. Variance of X
I calculate E(X²) first, then use the formula: Var(X) = E(X²) − [E(X)]²:

expected_X2 <- integrate(function(x) x^2 * f(x), lower = 0, upper = Inf)$value
variance_X <- expected_X2 - expected_X^2

Output: 0.125

## 🔹 E. The standard deviation of X
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

std_dev_X <- sqrt(variance_X)

Output:0.3535534
I calculated the probability that X is within 0.75 standard deviations of the expected value:
## F. The probability that X is within 0.75 standard deviations of its expected value

lower_bound <- expected_X - 0.75 * std_dev_X
upper_bound <- expected_X + 0.75 * std_dev_X
prob_within_075_sd <- integrate(f, lower = lower_bound, upper = upper_bound) 

Output: 0.5677911 

This project demonstrates how to work with continuous probability distributions using R. I explored key statistical properties like expectation, variance, and probabilities over defined intervals using integration.
